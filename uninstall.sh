# Same closed-environment re-exec as install.sh, and for the same reason:
# nothing here crosses a privilege boundary the way omarchy-pkg-add does,
# but omarchy-plugin-disable and systemctl are still resolved by bare name
# below, so they get the same trusted, pinned PATH rather than whatever
# the caller's shell had.
# See install.sh's matching comment: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
# are required for `systemctl --user` below, and OMARCHY_PATH for
# omarchy-plugin-disable (it shells out to omarchy-shell, which refuses to
# run without it).
